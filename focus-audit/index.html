        <h1>Stop Juggling.<br>Start Finishing.</h1>
        <p class="subhead"><strong>The Focus Audit:</strong> 60 minutes to cut 80% of your to-do list and finally make progress on what matters.</p>
        
        <div class="divider"></div>
        
        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>You're not lazy. You're not disorganized. <span class="highlight">You're drowning in opportunity.</span></p>
        <p>Too many ideas. Too many projects. Too many "priorities."</p>
        <p>You start Monday with a plan. By Wednesday, three new opportunities show up and you're chasing all of them. By Friday, nothing shipped.</p>
        
        <div class="quote">"Focus has been my biggest hurdle... I constantly generate new ideas, and I love the novelty. Where do you stop?"</div>
        
        <h2>The Real Issue</h2>
        <p>The problem isn't time management. It's that you're operating like a <strong>machine gun</strong> when you need to be a <strong>sniper</strong>.</p>
        <p>Every "yes" to something new is a "no" to finishing what you started.</p>
        <p>But cutting feels impossible because everything seems important.</p>
        
        <h2>The Focus Audit</h2>
        <p>In 60 minutes, we'll:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Dump everything</strong> — Get every project, idea, and "someday" out of your head</li>
            <li><strong>Apply the Sniper Filter</strong> — Ruthlessly evaluate each item against what actually moves the needle</li>
            <li><strong>Cut 80%</strong> — Yes, really. Most of what you're doing doesn't matter.</li>
            <li><strong>Lock your Sniper List</strong> — Walk away with exactly 3 priorities for the next 30 days</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>What You Get</h2>
        <ul class="check-list">
            <li>Pre-session brain dump template (you fill this out before we meet)</li>
            <li>60-minute live Focus Audit session</li>
            <li>Your written "Sniper List" — 3 priorities, clear next actions</li>
            <li>7-day follow-up check-in to make sure you're executing</li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="guarantee">
            <strong>Guarantee:</strong> Full refund if you don't leave with absolute clarity on your #1 priority.

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-q">What if I already know what I should focus on?</div>
                <div class="faq-a">Then why aren't you doing it? Knowing and doing are different. The Audit gives you the structure to actually commit.</div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-q">Is this coaching? Consulting?</div>
                <div class="faq-a">Neither. It's a working session. We make decisions together, and you leave with a concrete plan.</div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-q">What happens after the 60 minutes?</div>
                <div class="faq-a">You execute. I check in at 7 days to see how you're doing. If you want ongoing accountability, we can discuss, but there's no pressure.</div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-q">What if I can't cut 80%?</div>
                <div class="faq-a">You can. You just haven't had someone force you to make the hard calls. That's what I'm here for.</div>

        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>I'm Dave. I've spent years talking to entrepreneurs about what's holding them back. The #1 answer? "I have too much going on."</p>
        <p>This isn't a course. It's not a system you'll forget. It's one focused session to cut the noise and lock in what matters.</p>
        <p><strong>Let's get you focused.</strong></p>
